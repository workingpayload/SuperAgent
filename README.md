---

## 📦 Installation

### Use instantly (recommended)

```bash
npx @workingpayload/agent-skills install
```

### Or install globally

```bash
npm install -g @workingpayload/agent-skills
```

### Install specific skills only

```bash
npx @workingpayload/agent-skills install -s CodeSage,TestCrafter,BugHunter Pro
```

### Install for Gemini

```bash
npx @workingpayload/agent-skills install -t gemini
```

### Install for Google Antigravity

```bash
npx @workingpayload/agent-skills install -t antigravity
```

Skills are installed as directory-based packages (`SKILL.md` + optional scripts/references) to `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/`. The Antigravity agent automatically matches skills to your tasks via semantic triggering.

---

## 🧪 Usage

### Use skills in Claude Code

After installing, invoke skills as slash commands:

```
/codesage          → "Review this function for security issues"
/bughunter-pro     → "Debug this failing test"
/testcrafter       → "Write unit tests for UserService"
/python-master     → "Fix this async race condition"
/react-ranger      → "Build a search component with debounce"
/fastapi-furious   → "Create a CRUD API for products"
/dockmaster        → "Optimize my Dockerfile"
/kubecrafter       → "Write a Deployment manifest with HPA"
```

### Use skills in Google Antigravity

After installing with `-t antigravity`, skills are available automatically via semantic triggering — no slash commands needed. The Antigravity agent reads skill descriptions and matches them to your task:

```
"Review this function for security issues"   → agent activates CodeSage skill
"Debug this failing test"                    → agent activates BugHunter Pro skill
"Generate a codemap for this repo"           → agent activates CodeMap skill
```

Skills are installed as directories under `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/`, each containing a `SKILL.md` and optional `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` subdirectories.

### Find the right skill

```bash
npx @workingpayload/agent-skills route "review my Python code"
# → codesage (score: 12), python-master (score: 12)

npx @workingpayload/agent-skills route "design database schema"
# → dataweaver (score: 20), modelsensei (score: 20)
```

## 🧠 CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `install` | Install skills to Claude or Gemini |
| `uninstall <names>` | Remove installed skills |
| `list` | List installed skills with timestamps |
| `route "<prompt>"` | Find the best skill for a task |
| `doctor` | Check health of installed skills |
| `validate` | Lint all skill files |
| `score` | Auto-score skills on quality metrics |
| `test` | Run adversarial tests on all skills |
| `build-index` | Regenerate skills.json routing index |

---

## ⚙️ Options

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-t, --target` | Target platform: `claude`, `gemini`, or `antigravity` |
| `-s, --skills` | Comma-separated skill names to install |
| `--force` | Overwrite existing skills |
| `--dry-run` | Preview without writing files |
| `--validate` | Validate skills before installing |
| `--json` | Machine-readable output (score, route) |
| `--interactive` | Interactive prompt mode (route) |
| `-n, --top-n` | Number of routing results (default: 3) |

---

## 🗂️ Where Skills Are Installed

```
~/.claude/commands/                # Claude Code slash commands
~/.gemini/commands/                # Gemini skills
~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/      # Google Antigravity skills (directory-based)
```

Each skill becomes a slash command (Claude/Gemini) or a directory-based skill (Antigravity):

```
~/.claude/commands/codesage.md                → /codesage
~/.claude/commands/testcrafter.md             → /testcrafter
~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/codesage/SKILL.md  → auto-triggered by Antigravity agent
```

---

## 🩺 Health Checks

```bash
npx @workingpayload/agent-skills doctor
```

Checks:
* Install directory exists
* Meta file is valid
* All tracked skills are present on disk
* Installed skills match source (stale detection)
* No orphan files
* Frontmatter is valid

---

## 📊 Quality Tooling

```bash
# Lint all skills (CI gate)
npx @workingpayload/agent-skills validate

# Auto-score on 6 measurable criteria (0-30 scale)
npx @workingpayload/agent-skills score

# Run adversarial tests
npx @workingpayload/agent-skills test

# Generate machine-readable index
npx @workingpayload/agent-skills build-index
```

### Scoring Criteria

| Criterion | What it measures |
| --- | --- |
| Tool Coverage | Named tools/commands in backticks |
| Code Examples | Fenced code blocks with real examples |
| Edge Cases | Real-world failure scenarios covered |
| Actionability | Concrete numbered workflow steps |
| Structure | Frontmatter, overview, workflow, output format |
| Conciseness | Optimal line count (80-150 lines) |

---

## 🧩 Skill Format

Every skill file follows this structure:

```md
---
name: codesage
description: Performs structured code reviews with severity-tiered findings...
---

# CodeSage

## Overview
Expert code review covering security, correctness, performance...

## Workflow
### 1. Identify Language and Context
- Detect language, framework, runtime...

### 2. Static Analysis Pass
Run: `ruff check`, `mypy --strict`, `bandit -r .`...

## Edge Cases
1. Auto-generated code (Prisma, OpenAPI) — don't flag style...
2. False positive from linter — verify before reporting...

## Output Format
- Severity tier (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/NOTE)
- Code snippet with fix
- Verification command
```
